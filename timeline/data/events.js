This is known as the Dranison Revolution.\nThe free legions' leader, the human general Walston Dranison, executed the emperor, seized the imperial capital, was crowned Worston I, and renamed the realm the Dranison Empire. Thus the dynasty was later called the Dranison Dynasty.\nThe period ruled by the overthrown Emiton Empire was renamed the Dark Age by Dranison authorities.\nBecause the territory was vast, Walston divided the empire into three great kingdoms: the human-ruled Mattington Kingdom, the dwarf-ruled Chryomen Kingdom, and the elf-ruled Lothum Kingdom. Walston appointed trusted human, dwarf, and elf representatives from the free legions as the kings of each realm, and each kingdom pledged loyalty to the Dranison Empire.\nWalston set the capital at the crossroads of the three kingdoms, the city of Sumptano."

The three great kingdoms all sought to seize control, but none could fully prevail. The emperor at the time, Georson XIII (Georson Dranison), was captured.\nThe God of Light, Trinix's legion, the Paladins of Trinix, gained majority support and, after negotiating with the three kingdoms, secured the right to rule the empire. They promised to keep the name 'Dranison Empire,' maintain the three-kingdom system, and not interfere with each kingdom's internal balance of power. The legion was concentrated in the capital of Sumptano and reformed into the new emperor's guard. Their leader, the human paladin Hollison Tuka, ascended the throne as Hollison I with the consent of the three kingdoms and the people's support.\nTo honor Trinix, Hollison I named the dynasty the Trinixity Dynasty and made the Trinix faith the state religion. Even so, to uphold his promises to the three kingdoms, he did not punish nonbelievers and allowed the worship of other gods. Over time, under the Trinixity Dynasty, more new gods were born; five new godly sects emerged."

He renamed the dynasty after the Lothum Kingdom as the Lothum Dynasty. However, after the Lothum Dynasty was overthrown, later generations called it the Elven Dynasty, seemingly unwilling to acknowledge that the Lothum Kingdom once ruled the entire empire.\nAfter taking the throne, Lorin also renamed the empire the Lothum Empire and changed its era name. These actions greatly enraged the surviving humans.\nThe Lothum Empire abolished the three-kingdom system, though elven power remained concentrated within the former Lothum Kingdom.

After ascending the throne he changed his surname back to Dranison and crowned himself Carlos VII.\nCarlos restored the era name to the Dranison calendar and renamed the realm the Dranison Empire, becoming known as the New Dranison Dynasty. He called this move the 'Dranison Renaissance.' He also restored the three-kingdom system, leaving surviving elves in the Lothum Kingdom while humans and dwarves governed their own kingdoms. Though some humans felt this was too weak, most imperial subjects accepted it.\nHowever, to demean the previous dynasty, New Dranison histories uniformly called the Lothum Dynasty the Elven Dynasty, as if to remind humans of the dark age under other races. As a result, elves suffered discrimination under the New Dranison Dynasty. Most humans did not overtly show it, but their casual looks could not escape the elves' keen observation."
